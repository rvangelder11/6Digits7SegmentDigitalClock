# 6Digits7SegmentDigitalClock
fork of https://github.com/leonvandenbeukel/7-Segment-Digital-Clock-V2

I saw the 3D printable 7 segment clock of Leon van den Beukel and I liked it very much.
I have modified it as follows:
- Added 2 extra digits and a semi colon to add seconds
- Replaced the RTC with a link to NTP
- Modified the colors in such a way that all colors are shown and move one LED per second

  The 3D print information and a video can be found at <https://github.com/leonvandenbeukel/7-Segment-Digital-Clock-V2>

  The code can be found in the code section of this repository.

  To be able to connect to the WiFi, you have to modify Credentials.h with your Wifi SID name and password.
