# 6Digits7SegmentDigitalClock
fork of https://github.com/leonvandenbeukel/7-Segment-Digital-Clock-V2

I saw the 3D printable 7 segment clock of Leon van den Beukel and I liked it very much.
I have modified it as follows:
- Added 2 extra digits and a semi colon to add seconds
- Replaced the RTC with a link to the NTP server by connecting an ESP8266 to my Wifi
